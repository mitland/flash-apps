    answer:
      "The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It's often used to implement distributed event handling systems.",

    question: "What is the Strategy design pattern?",
    answer:
      "The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it, allowing for flexible and reusable code.",

    question: "What is the MVC design pattern?",
    answer:
      "Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main components: the Model (data), the View (user interface), and the Controller (processes that handle input). It helps in organizing code and separating concerns.",
